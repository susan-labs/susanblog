## Why am I creating this ?

Hi, I'm a great follower of NetworkChuck and I've started creating my own blog posts of the things that I've done during my career. 

So, I'll be dumping all of my learnings throughout my career here in my blogpost, hopefully it stays alive for a long time.

# From where am I following this process?
I'm following the same process as networkchuck did in his youtube channel. It seems pretty simple and straightforward if we follow the steps that he've done.
